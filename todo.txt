FEATURE:
mouse picking
shadow mapping
set canvas items position and scale by screen percentage
dynamically change game resolution
improve lighting
import fonts from .ttf .otf

BUG FIX:
improve default skybox texture

OPTIMIZATION:
make terrain generation better
precompute camera projection * camera view matrices
function timing
use mapping to update constant buffers
optimize input
replace math.h's trig functions
look into getting rid of padding variables in constant buffer structs

CLEANUP:
organize mathematics.h
combine VertexOutput and PixelInput structs in shaders
possibly unify renderer initialization code
everything

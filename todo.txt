FEATURE:
infinite terrain
instance rendering
mouse picking
shadow mapping
improve lighting
import fonts from .ttf .otf

BUG FIX:
figure out why i need to invert terrain normals
fix skybox twitching (most likely matrix4ToQuaternion)
make text and canvas positioning scale with window
handle updating resolution on window resize
improve default skybox texture

OPTIMIZATION:
precompute camera projection * camera view matrices
function timing
use mapping to update constant buffers
optimize input
replace math.h's trig functions
look into getting rid of padding variables in constant buffer structs

CLEANUP:
organize mathematics.h
combine VertexOutput and PixelInput structs in shaders
possibly unify renderer initialization code
everything

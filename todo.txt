FEATURE:
mouse picking
terrain generation and rendering
instance rendering
skybox rendering
shadow mapping
import fonts from .ttf .otf
improve lighting

BUG FIX:
make text and canvas positioning scale with window
handle updating resolution on window resize

OPTIMIZATION:
precompute camera projection * camera view matrices
function timing
use mapping to update constant buffers
optimize input
replace math.h's trig functions
look into getting rid of padding variables in constant buffer structs

CLEANUP:
organize mathematics.h
possibly unify renderer initialization code
